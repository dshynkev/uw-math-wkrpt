# UW Math Faculty work term report template

This is my template for University of Waterloo **Math Faculty** work term reports.
I share it in hope others may find it useful.

### How to use this

First, create the report:

1. Write the report using `wkrpt.tex` as a template.
2. List your sources in `wkrpt.bib` using the BibTeX format.
3. Create a `signature.png` file with a scan of your signature.

Next, run `make` to produce `wkrpt.pdf` and `make clean` to remove intermediates.

### Correctness guarantees

None. Use at your own peril. That said, this received 17/20 on formatting in Spring 2018.
